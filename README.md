# hv-thesis-template-typst
University West (HV) thesis template in typst.

The documentation is **shit** (non existant) and I will not maintain this repo (classic).
Anyways, the template should be mostly functioning. Check out typst.app for documentation about templates. The following is a good start: https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/making-a-template/.
The important files are `main.typ` and `lib.typ`. Ideally, you won't have to change anything in lib.typ. Altough, I can't guarante that. **Start** with checking out `main.typ`
Also, typst.app does have a very good editor and enviroment for writing typst documents. Otherwise, you can set it up yourself with tinymist in VSCODE for example.
Also, I strongly reccomend using Zotero and exporting sources to biblatex.
